# Hotel Customer Segmentation
---

> *How can we group hotel customers to create targeted marketing strategies and tailored services?*

## Introduction
Customer segmentation is the marketing process of separating your customers into groups based on certain standard features and is a precursor to targeting and positioning. Customer segmentation becomes critical to address successful marketing strategies and create a compelling service portfolio. 

Historically, customer segmentation has been performed by sorting and classifying customers by standard features or behavior patterns. Clustering algorithms can unveil underlying trends and associations hidden from the classic analysis and help create a more effective customer segmentation.

## Methodology
The present project presents the customer/guest segmentation for a urban hotel in Lisbon, Portugal. It has been used a dataset containing records of bookings of a city hotel (H2), with 31 variables describing 79,330 observations between the 1st of July of 2015 and the 31st of August 2017

The steps followed in this project are:
1. [Data wrangling](https://github.com/jvrnuno/Capstone-2/blob/master/notebooks/1A_JNT_collection_and_inspection.ipynb)
2. [Exploratory data analysis (EDA)](https://github.com/jvrnuno/Capstone-2/blob/master/notebooks/1B_JNT_cleaning_and_optimization.ipynb)
4. [Preprocessing](https://github.com/jvrnuno/Capstone-2/blob/master/notebooks/3_JNT_Pre-processing.ipynb)
5. [Modeling and results](https://github.com/jvrnuno/Capstone-2/blob/master/notebooks/4_JNT_Modelling.ipynb)
